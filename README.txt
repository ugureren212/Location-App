Thanks for looking at my app!

This app allows users to:
	- Pin markers based on their current location
	- Store locations into a DB
	- Generated a route from your current geo location to an existing blue marker
	- Search a location, using the search bar, to find existing markers around the specified locaiton

You can also find your current location and generate a path by:
	1) Find your current location by clicking the "Find my location" button
	2) Select an existing blue marker (pop up must be open)
	3) Generate a route clicking on the "find route from my location button"


to find existing markers around the specified locaiton you must:

	- select a location usi the search bar
	- A blue radius will be drawn at the desired locaiton. The radius can be adjusted using the slider (only up to a 5 mile radius)
	- The markers closest to your search location, within the user defined radius, will be placed on the table bellow.

To run the server you must open the terminal and type "npm run ugur".

THE EXISTING MARKERS WILL ONLY APPEAR ONCE THE DB IS RUNNING.

Thanks for looking at my app.

PS: The file names are a bit messy, originally this app was meant for gym parks and not general locations.
